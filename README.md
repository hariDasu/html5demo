User Editable Content Generation


HTML5 allows for the client to easily edit content on an HTML page. In this example, any elements with the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute set will have a grey outline as you hover over. Feel free to edit and change their contents.  Local storage is being employed to maintain your changes.


The editable content is actually a very simple code modification that allows for dynamic content generation. The real magic is HTML5's local storage. HTML5's local storage is simply a way for web pages to store named key/value pairs locally, within the client web browser. This data persists even after you navigate away form the web site. i.e. close browser, tab, etc.
